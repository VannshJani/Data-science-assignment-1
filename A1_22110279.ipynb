    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Problem:**\n",
    "   - We have a population of 1,000,000 people.\n",
    "   - At least 1% (i.e., 10,000 people) are coffee drinkers.\n",
    "   - We need to estimate this fraction using sampling and determine the error bounds with 99% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define the Random Variables:**\n",
    "   - Let $X_i$ be a Bernoulli random variable that equals 1 if the $i$-th person in the sample is a coffee drinker, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "   - The probability $p$ that $X_i = 1$ is at least 0.01 (since 1% of the population are coffee drinkers).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate the Sample Mean:**\n",
    "   - Take a random sample of size $n$.\n",
    "   - The sample mean $\\hat{p}$ is given by:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\hat{p} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - Here, $\\hat{p}$ represents the fraction of coffee drinkers in the sample.\n",
    "   - The expected value $\\mu$ of $\\hat{p}$ is:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\mu = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{p}] = p \\geq 0.01\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Apply the Multiplicative Chernoff Bound:**\n",
    "   - To determine the error bounds with 99% probability, we'll use the multiplicative Chernoff bound:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\Pr(|X - \\mu| \\geq \\delta \\mu) \\leq 2e^{-\\delta^2 \\mu / 3}, \\qquad 0 < \\delta < 1.\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     We can see from the equation above that, X will deviate from it's mean $\\mu$ by more than $\\delta \\mu$ with a probability less than or equal to $2e^{-\\delta^2 \\mu / 3}$ hence, we want this value to be less than equal to 0.01 to get a confidence of atleast 99%.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Set the Probability Bound:**\n",
    "   - We need to find $n$ such that the probability of error is at most 1% (or atleast 99% confidence). We set $2e^{-\\delta^2 \\mu / 3} \\leq 0.01$ to achieve this.\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     2e^{-\\delta^2 \\mu / 3} = 0.01 \\implies e^{-\\delta^2 \\mu / 3} = 0.005 \\implies -\\delta^2 \\mu / 3 = \\ln(0.005) \\implies \\delta^2 \\mu / 3 = -\\ln(0.005) \\implies \\delta^2 = \\frac{3 \\ln(1/0.005)}{\\mu}\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Solve for Sample Size $n$:**\n",
    "   - Since $\\mu = p \\geq 0.01$, we have:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     \\delta^2 = \\frac{3 \\ln(200)}{0.01} \\approx 1386.29\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "   - To ensure the error bound holds, the sample size $n$ should be large enough. Therefore:\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     n = \\frac{\\delta^2}{p} \\geq \\frac{1386.29}{0.01} \\approx 138,629\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the square root to find $\\delta$: $$ \\delta \\approx \\sqrt{1386.29} \\approx 37.23 $$\n",
    "The error bound is: $$ \\delta \\mu = 37.23 \\times 0.01 \\approx 0.3723 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Size:** Approximately 138,629\n",
    "- **Error Bound:** With 99% probability, the estimate of the fraction of coffee drinkers will be within approximately 0.3723 of the true fraction.\n"
